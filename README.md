s1-mirror
=========

A public mirror of a private server's web interface. Here because I like GitHub and am lazy.

Even lazier! Here's a GitHub-hosted version of this (note that this is only partially functional, since I can't reconfigure GitHub's servers to match mine): http://danny316p.github.io/s1-mirror/
